# a test file for the MonCarlo class (moncarlo.py)

# Note that you do not need to create an __init__() method in this class, 
# nor do you have to define any class variables.
# Instead, treat every method as a small, stand-alone program 
# in which you create a new object for your test. 
# This is not the best practice in a production environment, 
# but it works and it will enable you to get the gist of unit testing.
